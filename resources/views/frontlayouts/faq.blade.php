                                            <br>
                                            * Fee – Fee for the engagement. This could be a flat fee or an hourly fee.<br>

                                            * Commission – if there were a particular product that fit your situation, we would be able to implement a product where the product company compensates us.<br>
                                            * Hybrid – Combination approach<br>
                                            Each implementation strategy has its benefits and its draw backs. The key catalyst for making a decision is based on your situation.

                                            Diversifying advisors may provide you insight to the different levels of service other investment professionals provide. However, this perceived diversification may result in inadequate financial planning due to a lack of knowledge of holdings elsewhere, as well as potentially unsuitable investment allocations due to the lack of knowledge of material changes to your account(s) with other institutions. The investor also may be able to save on overall investment related expenses by consolidating accounts and taking advantage of relative economies of scale.
